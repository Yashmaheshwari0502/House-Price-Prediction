# House Prices Prediction

Welcome to the California Housing Prices Prediction project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting house prices in California using various machine learning models. The project includes data loading, exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training with Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms.


## Introduction

This project aims to predict house prices in California based on various features such as location (longitude and latitude), housing characteristics (housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households), socio-economic factors (median_income), and proximity to the ocean (ocean_proximity). These features provide a comprehensive view of the factors influencing house prices across different locations in California.

The models employed in this project include Linear Regression and Random Forest. These models are trained to predict the median house value based on the aforementioned features, leveraging machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
